# 1.- What mean Object oriented programming in js?

1a.- Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing code that allows you to create different objects from a common object (Class).

The common object is usually called a Blueprint while the created objects are called Instances.

1b.- The second aspect of Object-Oriented Programming is about structuring code when you have multiple levels of blueprints.

1c.- The third aspect of Object Oriented Programming is about encapsulation where you hide certain pieces of information within the object so theyâ€™re not accessible.

# 2.- What is class in Javascript?

JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects. Classes are used to create objects.

In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

# 3.- What is an Object in Javascript?

An object is a collection of properties and methods (functions). A property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

# 4.- What are the benefits of using SASS over CSS?

SASS is like CSS but with superpowers.

Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct, so you can write CSS quicker.

It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS.

It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.

It includes mixins. Mixins are like functions in other programming languages.

# 5.- What is constructors in JS?

Constructors are functions that contain a collection of "this" keyword, this lets you store (and access) unique values created for each instance. You can create an instance with the new keyword.

# 6.- What is CSS combinator?

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- Descendant selector (space):
  The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

- Child selector (>):
  The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

- Adjacent sibling selector (+):
  The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

- General sibling selector (~):
  The general sibling selector selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

# 7.- How can you make a click event in JS?

Using JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener.

Example: Add an event listener that fires when a user clicks a button:

document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", displayDate);

# 8.- What is JavaScript HTML DOM?
